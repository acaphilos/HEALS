# HEALS
Health Appointment and Log System

HEALS (Health Appointment and Log System) is a platform designed to make booking
for health appointment easier and provide patients with a centralized platform to view
and manage their medical information. The project is conducted with motivation to
tackle issues such as the difficulties of booking healthcare appointments and troublesome
traditional medical record management. The purpose of the system is
to allow patients to input their symptoms and medical information, get an early
checkup for their symptoms and plan an appointment with a doctor. The platform uses machine learning algorithms to provide
early checkup of the possible conditions based on given symptoms. The expected outcome of the project is to help users make
informed decisions when scheduling clinic appointments and to ease the management
of patientsâ€™ medical records
